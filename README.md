## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
### Introduction
#### Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!

As a young data analyst, I do several real-world duties in this case study. I work for a fictitious corporation, and I use the phases of the data analysis process to address crucial business questions: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. I will have a portfolio-ready case study at the end of this case study.
